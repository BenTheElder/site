It's worth noting that I did NOT wind up playing Fallout 76 much
further.
After the B.E.T.A. my interest fell off quickly as the locations and quests failed to be as engaging for me as previous Fallout games.

<hr>

During the first B.E.T.A. some places I discovered along my travels were:

<div style="border-left: 3px solid #3388ff; margin-left:-5px;">
{{% md %}}
1. [**Vault 76**](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Vault_76) - An underground bunker where the journey begins.
  <img class="centered" src="/images/fallout76/photo_2018-10-31_01-06-00.jpg"/>
  <img class="centered" src="/images/fallout76/photo_2018-10-31_01-06-02.jpg" />
  <img class="centered" src="/images/fallout76/photo_2018-10-31_01-06-03.jpg"/>

2. A crashed prop-plane of some sort at a farm.
  <img class="centered" src="/images/fallout76/photo_2018-10-31_01-06-06.jpg"/>
  <img class="centered" src="/images/fallout76/photo_2018-10-31_01-06-07.jpg"/>

3. The Vault [Overseer](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Vault_76_overseer)'s encampment. A pretty basic camp with a fire, some workbenches, and some storage chests.
  <img class="centered" src="/images/fallout76/photo_2018-10-31_19-23-27.jpg"/>


4. A tiny shack in the woods, guarded by a lone [Protectron](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Protectron).
   <img class="centered" src="/images/fallout76/photo_2018-10-31_18-53-48.jpg"/>

5. An abandoned water treatment plant. Overrun with [Liberator](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Liberator_(Fallout_76)) robots.

6. A large crashed plane, apparently a commercial airline. - 
  I explored the inside and found some interesting loot. The area was also heavily
patrolled by Super Mutants, and they had an encampment nearby.
  <img class="centered" src="/images/fallout76/photo_2018-10-31_01-06-10.jpg"/>
  <img class="centered" src="/images/fallout76/photo_2018-10-31_01-06-11.jpg"/>
  <img class="centered" src="/images/fallout76/photo_2018-10-31_01-06-11_2.jpg"/>

7. A pharmeceutical company's building, with a very cool retro-futuristic asthetic.
  <img class="centered" src="/images/fallout76/photo_2018-10-31_01-06-12.jpg"/>
  <img class="centered" src="/images/fallout76/photo_2018-10-31_18-49-48.jpg"/>

8. Bolton Greens - A daycare for rich kids run by a robot, who was very concerned 
with preparation for "The Halloween Gala". I took on a side quest to help for [caps](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Bottle_cap), which mostly consisted of reminding other
robots to return to the daycare and prepare for Halloween.
  <img class="centered" src="/images/fallout76/photo_2018-10-31_19-10-52.jpg"/>

9. Top of the World - A ski resort with a more retro-futuristic architecture 
including a geodesic dome. I was attacked and killed by Super Mutant Skirmisher here.
  <img class="centered" src="/images/fallout76/photo_2018-10-31_19-07-26.jpg"/>

{{% md %}}
1. Vault 76 again.
  <img class="centered" src="/images/fallout76/photo_2018-10-31_01-21-57.jpg"/>

2. A logging plant, with logging robots still hard at work. One of them gave
me some extra wood scraps, and said something like "Must. Chop. Wood. Forever."
  <img class="centered" src="/images/fallout76/photo_2018-10-31_19-19-51.jpg"/>

3. A small town. Various factions resided here once, all long gone.

4. An agricultural research facility, tended by many robot farmers.

5. Poseidon - A nuclear power plant. There seemed to be a quest to get the power
working again, but I moved on to explore other areas for now.
  <img class="centered" src="/images/fallout76/photo_2018-10-31_01-22-06.jpg"/>

6. A train station - A lone Protectron vendor resided here. There were no trains.

7. The remains of [Charleston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston,_West_Virginia), specifically the capital building. I spotted [The Grafton Monster](https://www.vgr.com/beasts-west-virginia-grafton-monster/) lurking around here and breifly engaged before wisening up and running away. I'll have to come back when I've leveled up further.
  <img class="centered" src="/images/fallout76/photo_2018-10-31_01-22-01.jpg"/>

8. The remains of an Airport, with many broken planes, and one more large crashed airplane
against the air traffic control tower. The area was teeming with Super Mutants similar
to the previous crash.

<p class="title" style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: .25em;">November 1st B.E.T.A.</p>

<hr>

I got in another hour during the November 1st session.

<div style="border-left: 3px solid #ce0019; margin-left:-5px;">
{{% md %}}
1. The Burning Mine - As the name suggests, a burnt out mine. This was the first
and only place I visited in the "Ash Heap Region". Thankfully I had already
equipped a gas mask which saved me from getting lung disease many times ...
There was a Power Armor station here, but the game broke when I tried to enter the power armor.
This area had _many_ high level Scorched. I also aquired a shotgun here.

  <img class="centered" src="/images/fallout76/photo_2018-11-02_00-13-14.jpg"/>


2. Hornwright Air Purifier Site #02 - Some malfunctioning terminals attached
to some strange looking "air purifier", presumably there's a quest to fix these
at some point, not much else here.
  <img class="centered" src="/images/fallout76/photo_2018-11-02_00-22-18.jpg"/>
  <img class="centered" src="/images/fallout76/photo_2018-11-02_00-22-23.jpg"/>


3. Uncanny Caverns - Some kind of tourist spot, I encountered a "vicious wolf" here.
  <img class="centered" src="/images/fallout76/photo_2018-11-02_00-24-14.jpg"/>

4. R & G Processing Services - Some kind of industrial plant.
  <img class="centered" src="/images/fallout76/photo_2018-11-02_00-32-27.jpg"/>

5. Spruce Knob - "The highest place in West Virginia". I "captured" a public
workspace there before moving on. There was also some kind of monorail like train
station, with two cars there.
  <img class="centered" src="/images/fallout76/photo_2018-11-02_00-11-27.jpg"/>

6. South Mountain Lookout - A Lookout Tower.
  <img class="centered" src="/images/fallout76/photo_2018-11-02_00-31-20.jpg"/>

<p class="title" style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: .25em;">Notes</p>
<hr>

- Crashed planes are definitely a thing in Appalachia, there are a _lot_ of
crashed planes, I suspect part of the plot (possibly for the "scorched" enemies)
will revolve around this somehow.

- Robots play a much bigger part in this world.

I streamed most of my time on YouTube, you can watch [the first day here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npIzLI7kvU8) and [the second day here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta_gC2npUPo). I didn't capture everything in this post.

I had fun, but had some frustration with the menus, particularly with the tab key
being used to go back instead of escape. The menus for binding equippables were 
also frustrating, both of these lead to a few in-game deaths. I also experienced
a few small bugs, but no show-stoppers.

Proximity voice chat also led to some ... interesting moments, including a
ringing iPhone and a McDonalds order placed from the wastelands of West 
Virginia <span class="emoji" style="background-image:url(/images/emoji/emoji_u1f914.png)" title=":thinking:">:thinking:</span>
