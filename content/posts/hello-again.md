Hello World! I am now the proud owner of <a href="https://bentheelder.io">bentheelder.io</a>.

If you are curious, you can find the page source for the new site <a href="https://github.com/BenTheElder/site">here</a>, and the scripts used to set up the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/">GCE</a> VM <a href="https://github.com/BenTheElder/site-scripts">here</a>.  

The new site is also now on <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> for performance and security.

The <a href="https://bentheelder.github.io">old site</a> will be redirected to this one soon, and what little content it had has been preserved here. The pages have been
 reformatted to match the new site, and should be much easier on the eyes.

{{% update %}}I've since [migrated my site to Kubernetes](/posts/migrating-my-site-to-kubernetes).{{% /update %}}
