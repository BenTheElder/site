My name is Benjamin Elder, though I am frequently known as Ben / [BenTheElder].
I enjoy gaming, hiking, and building things.
I want computers / machines to help people do more.

During [Google Summer of Code][summer-of-code] 2015 I [implemented][kube-proxy-pr] Tim Hockin's [proposal][kube-proxy-issue] to use iptables isntead of userspace for proxying in [Kubernetes]'s [kube-proxy], which later evolved into the current default implementation.

More recently I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from
<a href="http://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a> in the Spring of 2017 with
"<a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/future/undergraduates/bscs/threads">threads</a>" in
<a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/devices">Devices</a> and
<a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/intelligence">Intelligence</a>.
I joined Google as a Software Engineer ("SWE") in the Summer of 2017, working on [Test Infrastructure / GitHub Automation][test-infra] for Kubernetes.

Currently my work is focused primarily on local test clusters with <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind">KIND</a>, which I created and maintain.
I also help maintain Kubernetes - particularly builid, test, and release.
I hope to improve the developer and contributor experience. I love working
with the community.
