title: About Ben
---
My name is Benjamin Elder, though I am frequently known as Ben / [BenTheElder].
I enjoy gaming, hiking, and building things. I love [my dog].
I want computers / machines to help people do more and focus on what really matters.

I am an open source software developer.
I help maintain [Kubernetes] – particularly build, test, release, project infrastructure ... through which I hope to improve the developer and contributor experience. I love working
with the community.
