My name is Benjamin Elder, though I am frequently known as Ben / [BenTheElder].
I enjoy hiking, gaming, and building things. I love [my wife] and [my dog].
I want machines to help people do more and focus on what really matters.

I am an open source software developer.
I help maintain [Kubernetes] – particularly build, test, release, project infrastructure ... through which I hope to improve the developer and contributor experience. To that end [kind] is my favorite and probably my most popular project. I love working
with the community.

## Speaking

I'm a novice speaker with a few [KubeCon](https://www.cncf.io/kubecon-cloudnativecon-events/) talks and a couple
of smaller internal (company) talks under my belt. My public talks are listed below.

### KubeCon NA 2019

I gave one talk and ran a workshop at [KubeCon NA 2019]. I also anchored a table
at a [mentoring session](https://kccncna19.sched.com/event/WV57/mentoring-networking-signup-to-be-a-mentee-or-a-mentor) and represented Kubernetes [SIG Testing] and
WG K8s Infra at the Kubernetes [Contributor Summit](https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubernetes-contributor-summit-north-america-2019/) [Meet & Greet](https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubernetes-contributor-summit-north-america-2019/program/schedule/).

#### Deep Dive: KIND - Benjamin Elder & Antonio Ojea

We spoke about [KIND internals and the challenges ahead on the road to 1.0](https://kccncna19.sched.com/event/Uah7/deep-dive-kind-benjamin-elder-google-antonio-ojea-garcia-suse).

{{< lazyYoutube id="tT-GiZAr6eQ" title="Deep Dive: Kind - Benjamin Elder, Google & Antonio Ojea Garcia, SUSE" >}}

#### A Kind Workflow for Contributing to Kubernetes - Benjamin Elder & Duffie Cooley & James Munnelly & Patrick Lang

We ran a hands on tutorial for contributing and testing your Kubernetes code with [KIND].

This is one of my favorites. 462 people registered as attending this workshop! I really enjoyed going around helping people get through the workshop instead of speaking for
most of the session.
Hopefully many of them learned something about contributing to Kubernetes and using KIND.

### KubeCon EU 2019

I gave two talks at [KubeCon EU 2019] and participated as a mentor in one of the mentoring sessions, I also held a Kubernetes Contributor Summit Session on KIND (voted for / requested at the summit).

#### Testing your K8s apps with KIND - Benjamin Elder & James Munnelly

We spoke about [KIND and testing your Kubernetes Applications][testing-k8s-apps-with-kind].

I was pretty jet-lagged for this talk but I was blown away by the response. I really
enjoyed this talk and the Q&A, and I love working with my good friend [James Munnelly].

#### Deep Dive: Testing SIG - Benjamin Elder & James Munnelly

We spoke about KIND and how we use it to test Kubernetes for the [SIG Testing Deep Dive][sig-testing-deep-dive-kind].

{{< lazyYoutube id="6m9frvTxK0o" title="Deep Dive: Testing SIG - Benjamin Elder, Google & James Munnelly, Jetstack" >}}

### KubeCon NA 2018

I gave one talk at [KubeCon NA 2018] and ran a Kubernetes Contributor Summit session on KIND (voted for / requested at the summit).

#### Behind Your PR: How Kubernetes Uses Kubernetes to Run Kubernetes CI - Sen Lu & Benjamin Elder

I spoke with [Sen Lu][@krzyzacy] about The Kubernetes Project's
testing tools and infrastructure, including a brief discussion of [KIND] and running
it on Kubernetes's [Kubernetes-based CI infrastructure][prow].
